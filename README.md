## About this App

### Description

Passwizard is a password generator application that allows users to personalize and create their own random passwords.

### User Story

As a user looking for a strong password, I would like an application that allows me to generate a password that is completely random. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with a simple form where my password will eventually be displayed for me to use. After clicking "Generate Password", a series of windows asks me a series of questions regarding how I would like my password to be formatted. After answering the prompts, my password is generated and displayed for me to copy and use.
